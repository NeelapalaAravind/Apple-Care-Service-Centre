<p>All Apple Stores feature a Genius Bar, where customers can receive technical advice or set up service and repair for their products. The Genius Bar provides hardware service on products that are not classified vintage or obsolete.[98] However, in most cases the Geniuses will at least attempt to assist customers with older hardware</p>
